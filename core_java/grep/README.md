# Introduction

The Java Grep App is a Java application that takes in three inputs from the user: `regex`, `rootPath`, and `setOutFile`, in order to look through a directory, list its files, look for lines in each file that match the given `regex` pattern, and write those matching lines to a new file. 

The App makes use of a `JavaGrepImp` class with methods and setters that work together to accomplish the tasks through a broad `process()` method. This class in turn is implemented from an interface called `JavaGrep`. The process of creating the app is discussed in more detail in the Implementation section of this `README.md`.

# Performance Issue 

This app is not optimized for memory efficiency. For processing larger files, the JVM may not be able to allocate an object due to insufficient space in the Java heap.
