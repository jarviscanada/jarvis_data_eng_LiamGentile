# Liam Gentile . Jarvis Consulting

I am a new and ambitious Data Engineer. Empowered by my experience as a Hockey Video Analyst at SportlogIQ, I decided to seek out a data science education from BrainStation. While I developed a broad range of skills in data science and computer science, I found myself particularly interested in the backend of the data world, namely data engineering. This interest led me to my role at Jarvis Consulting. The more coding heavy and problem solving aspects of working with data are what excite me about this field, and I am intrigued by the prospect of playing a critical role in the technical management of data, and indirectly, the health of the business overall.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_LiamGentile/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Built a set of tools that allow a user to monitor different nodes connected in a Linux Cluster by tracking hardware specifications and resource usage in real time and connecting that data automatically to a database. Some tools and technologies used include: Linux CentOS 7, VNC, Git, Bash, PostgreSQL, docker, crontab, Github, Agile & Scrum.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_LiamGentile/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - JDBC App: This app implements Java Database Connectivity, creating an API which allows us to interact with and modify a PostgreSQL database independently of the persistence layer.
  - Grep App: This is an application which takes three inputs from the user: regex, rootPath, and setOutFile, in order to look through a directory, list its files, look for lines in each file that match the given regex pattern, and write those matching lines to a new file. Deployed using Docker.
