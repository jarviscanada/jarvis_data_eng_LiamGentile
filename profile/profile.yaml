summary: "I have always been passionate about learning and problem solving. During my Bachelor's degree, I explored how the studies of economics, political science, and history can interact to help us learn from the past and work more effectively on international development challenges. I was first introduced to the world of data when I worked as a Hockey Video Analyst at Sportlogiq. While I worked in the space of sports data, my mind was opened to the immense possibilities of Data Science to help any type of business or organisation gain meaningful insights to both self-improve and improve the experience of those they serve. It was during my time at Sportlogiq that I realised I had to explore making a career in data. After going through a period of self-directed learning in Python, SQL, and Statistics, I decided to enroll in the BrainStation Data Science Diploma program. This program helped me to develop a wide-range of skills in data science and computer science more broadly, and my interest in data engineering grew from there. I love this field because I get to solve puzzles, I challenge myself every day, and I get to learn new tools and technologies all the time. "
